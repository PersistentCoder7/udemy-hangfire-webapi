Author: Ervis Trupja

A common programming task is running **background jobs** and running background jobs successfully without messing the code up is not an easy task, but it is not as hard you might think either.

_A background process/job is a process that runs behind the scenes without user intervention_ and hangfire is a simple, persistent, transparent, reliable and efficient open-source library used to perform background processing in .NET and .NET Core applications.
